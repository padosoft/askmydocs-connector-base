 * Contract every external-source connector implements.

 * A connector ships as a Laravel package declaring its FQCNs under
 * `composer.json::extra.askmydocs.connectors`. The {@see
 * ConnectorRegistry} auto-discovers every installed package at boot.
 *
 * The host framework guarantees:
 *   - Every method is invoked with the active
 *     {@see TenantContext}
 *     already resolved.
 *   - `$installationId` references a row in `connector_installations`
 *     scoped to the active tenant — the controller / job that calls
 *     into the connector enforces R30 isolation before reaching here.
 *   - Credentials are managed by {@see Auth\OAuthCredentialVault};
 *     concrete connectors NEVER persist tokens themselves.
 *
 * R23: every implementation MUST be validated by the registry at boot
 *      (`instanceof ConnectorInterface`).
