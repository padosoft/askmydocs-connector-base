/**
 * Raised when a connector's upstream API call fails for non-auth
 * reasons:
 *
 *   - 4xx other than 401/403 (bad request, rate limit, conflict, etc.)
 *   - 5xx (transient upstream outage)
 *   - non-JSON / malformed response bodies
 *
 * Use {@see ConnectorAuthException} ONLY for 401/403 + OAuth token-
 * exchange / state-token failures. Misclassifying a 503 upstream
 * outage as an auth problem hides the real cause from the admin UI
 * and triggers unnecessary "reinstall the connector" prompts.
 *
 * The default `ConnectorSyncJob` distinguishes the two:
 * `ConnectorAuthException` marks the installation as `errored` and
 * stops retrying; this one lets the job retry per its backoff policy
 * (transient outages usually resolve within a few minutes).
