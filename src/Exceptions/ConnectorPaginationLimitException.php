/**
 * Raised by a paginator when the `maxPages` bound is reached AND the
 * upstream signals `has_more=true`.
 *
 * Surfacing truncation as an exception (rather than silently returning
 * partial results) means a connector's outer try/catch records a
 * concrete `errors[]` entry on the {@see SyncResult}
 * so operators see the truncation in the admin log. A silent
 * truncation looks identical to a successful sync, and the next
 * incremental run would miss the truncated tail forever.
 *
 * Caller responsibility: catch this exception, log a warning, return
 * a partial SyncResult with `errors[]` indicating truncation. Do NOT
 * let it propagate as a hard sync failure — partial data is better
 * than no data, but the metric must reflect the truncation honestly.
 *
 * Note: `$partialResults` is intentionally kept empty by the
 * paginator. The caller already processed and ingested every yielded
 * batch before the cap was hit, so carrying the full set here would
 * double memory. Use the connector's own `$added` / `$updated`
 * counter for counts.
